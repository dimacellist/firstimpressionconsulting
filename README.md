This is my first React.js app.
The longterm project to migrate all my web pages to react.

You can view original non-React web page here:
[firstimpressionconsulting](http://www.firstimpressionconsulting.net)

In order to view the project, clone the repo and cd to the project directory.
Open console and run:

### `npm start`

Make sure to have Node.js installed on your machine
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

For the unit testing I have used Jest, Enzyme and Chai.
Installation: 
### `npm install --save-dev enzyme enzyme-adapter-react-16 jest-enzyme babel-jest`

### `$ npm install chai`

And run following command to run tests
### `test`



### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
