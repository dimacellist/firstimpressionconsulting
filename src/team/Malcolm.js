        I have been providing English language services in Lithuania for the past seven years.	
        Through designing and delivering courses, seminars and copy for various companies in 
        the region, I have developed an approach to language services which is based on working 
        closely with the client. This enables us to achieve results that provide added value 
        throughout the company: from the language that the company uses in its everyday 
        communication to the copy it uses to present itself to the world.

        “Having a good product or service is only the first step; the real 
        key is developing the language you need to sell it. That’s where First 
        Impression Consulting can really help.”</em>
