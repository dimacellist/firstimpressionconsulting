        I have been working as a professional freelance copywriter and English language 
        communications coach in Lithuania for the past 3 years.My background is in 
        lecturing and teaching History and Politics, and I achieved a Masters with 
        Distinction from the University of London, School of Oriental and African Studies. 
        My academic background helps me bring coherence and structure to the texts 
        I work on. And my experience as a teacher has given me vital skills for helping 
        clients with their public speaking and presentations.
